# Hemanth's Portfolio — Full Project Tour



## 🎯 Project Purpose

Hemanth's Portfolio solves the challenge of presenting your developer journey with maximum impact and seamless user experience. From first glance, it communicates proficiency in both **engineering best practices** and **user-focused design**, making it perfect for recruiters, clients, and collaborators.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. **Atomic Design System**

- **Atoms:** Basic elements (Button, Icon, Input, Card, LazyImage) promote high reusability and consistent styling throughout the UI.
- **Molecules:** Combine atoms to form functional UI units (Navigation bar, Layout, Footer), ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- **Organisms:** Built from molecules; represent full sections (Hero, About, Work, Contact), supporting clean separation of concerns.

### 2. **Code Structure**

```

**Advantages:**
- *Separation of concerns* for scalability
- *Readable, maintainable* structure for easy onboarding and extension
- Fully *typed and linted* for code quality

## 🚀 Getting Started — Quick Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemanthscode/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   nvm install && nvm use
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Create `.env`:
     ```
     VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
     VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
     VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
     ```

3. **Run Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

4. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

5. **Linting/Code Quality**
   ```bash
   npm run lint   # Check
   npm run lint:fix   # Auto-fix
   ```
6. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Push repo to GitHub, link in Netlify dashboard
   - Build: `npm run build`  
     Publish: `dist`
   - Set `VITE_EMAILJS_*` variables in Netlify dashboard
   - Deploy!

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

- **DOMPurify:** Sanitizes user input in forms against XSS.
- **ESLint/React Hooks:** Keeps code consistent and error-free.
- **Optimized assets:** All media compressed, lazy-loaded, and modern formats used.

##  Why This Architecture Works

- **Scalable:** Easily add new projects, sections, or pages by dropping new data/components.
- **Maintainable:** One source of truth for data and styles, strong lint/test ecosystem.
- **Professional:** Closely mirrors real-world, production-grade application practices.

## 🏁 What Sets This Portfolio Apart

- **True modularity:** Atomic design isn't just a buzzword—every component is independently useful.
- **Lightning-fast user journey:** No page reloads, instant route changes, and lazy-loaded assets.
- **Accessible to everyone:** Focus on semantic markup, ARIA, and responsive layouts.
- **Effortless deployment:** Deploy updates in seconds via Netlify (or any JAMstack host).
